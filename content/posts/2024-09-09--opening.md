Hello potters,

We're thrilled to announce that the studio is officially up and running! In recent weeks, we’ve installed new shelves, built tables, set up our pottery wheels, and organized the workstations. The kiln has been fired up and tested, and while we’re still adding tools, equipment and furnishings, we’re all set to begin classes this week.
