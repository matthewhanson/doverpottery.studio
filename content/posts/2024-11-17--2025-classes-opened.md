Greetings Potters!

This fall has been a whirlwind of activity as we settle into the rhythm of running a new business. It's been busy but exciting, with packed classes, a successful open house, and an amazing day at Apple Harvest Day. If you stopped by our tent, we hope you enjoyed our Pottery Pong game or snagged one of our limited-edition Apple Harvest Day stickers!

## Updates for 2025 Classes

We’re thrilled to announce that our January classes are now open for registration! After reflecting on this past year, we’ve made some changes for 2025. Here’s what’s new:

- Seven-Week Sessions: We’ve planned six seven-week sessions over 2025 which .
- Shorter Classes: Alongside the longer sessions, we’ll also offer a couple three- and four-week classes each session for those looking for a shorter commitment.
- Workshops: We’re introducing more specific workshops focused on building unique pieces or exploring seasonal themes.
- Explore Wheel Classes: Our popular one-session Explore Wheel classes will continue, perfect for beginners or anyone wanting to try their hand at the wheel. We’ve added several classes for December as well that still have space available.
