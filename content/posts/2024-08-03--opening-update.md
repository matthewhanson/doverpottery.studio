Hello everyone,

This update is overdue, but we are now getting close. In fact, so close we have an opening date for classes to begin September 10th, [sign up here](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes)!

Below are some more details on the state of the studio, but today we are at the [Cocheco Arts Festival](https://www.dovernh.org/events/details/cochecho-arts-festival-creative-arts-showcase-2024-40247) in Henry Law Park. Look for the gold pavilion with the Dover Pottery Studio logo.

## Studio Construction and Setup

The studio is nearly ready. The last few months have seen a complete remodel of the entire space at the Third Street Exchange: new epoxy floor, walls, electric, plumbing, HVAC. The space, which is over 2500 Sq Ft, has plenty of space for classes, shelves, glaze kitchen, and a dedicated member room which is always available.

We're setting up our first Kiln, with plans to add a second one in the coming months. We've got 10 Shimpo XL wheels to start with 2 in the member area. While we still have a lot to do this month to fill the space, we wanted to share some photos of the transformation over the last few months.

## Class Sign-ups and Materials
We're using [Kilnfire](https://kilnfire.com/) to handle [class sign-ups](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes) and [material purchases](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/supplies), which should make things easy and efficient for everyone. We're currently picking out the perfect glazes and ordering clay to ensure you have the best materials to work with. Additionally, we've received a new batch of stickers and will be ordering T-shirts for those of you who like the Studio's timeless logo.

We are starting with a series of single-session Explore classes and 4-week Intro classes. Longer 8 week Beginner Pottery and Multi-Level Wheel classes start October 15th. Look for more options in the coming weeks - more Explore classes and Seasonal Workshops.

## Community Events

As mentioned, today we at the [Cocheco Arts Festival Creative Arts Showcase](https://www.dovernh.org/events/details/cochecho-arts-festival-creative-arts-showcase-2024-40247). Stop by the gold pavilion to say hello, learn about classes and workshops and get a special introductory offer. It's a great opportunity to ask questions you may have.

On October 6th we will be at Apple Harvest Day. By then we will have more to share, games to play and some pottery to win.
