## Workshops

We will host workshops and group sessions suitable for any skill level, perfect for those eager to dive into pottery in a friendly atmosphere without any ongoing commitment. We will fire your creations and glaze them for you to pick up at a later date, and perhaps you sign up for an ongoing class.

## Classes

Classes will run 4 and 8 weeks, in both hand-building and wheel, and run 2.5 hours. Go all the way through, from a block of clay through firing, glazing, then firing to the final work.

## Membership

Members gain 24/7 access to our facilities, ensuring that inspiration is never hindered by time constraints. A dedicated member area means there's no conflicts with classes.

## The Studio

The Studio itself is spacious, providing a dedicated class area, a member room, a glaze kitchen, and plenty of shelving. With new Cone 6 L&L Kilns and Shimpo XL pottery wheels, the Studio invests in high quality tools and equipment.

## Community

Becoming part of Dover Pottery Studio means joining a vibrant, supportive community of creatives unified by a love for pottery. It's an ideal place for anyone looking to enhance their skills, connect with fellow pottery lovers, or simply discover the art of pottery.

## Stay Tuned

Watch for updates with more information on the location, our grand opening and upcoming workshops and classes.
