While classes include enough clay for many students, you may find yourself needing more clay 
if you come to more open studio times. Clay can be purchased through our Supplies page in our Kilnfire app once you are
signed up for a class or membership.

Dover Pottery Studio includes all glaze and firing fees into the cost of the clay. All clay 
used in our kiln must come from the studio.

We stock a few different types of clay and will continue to try out new clay bodies as there is interest.
Please let us know what you would like to see!

We also have merch available from time to time, keep checking back!
