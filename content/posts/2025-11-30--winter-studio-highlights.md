Pop-Up Pots are on-location, single-session handbuilding classes hosted at partner venues throughout the community. Each event features a guided clay project designed to be enjoyable for all levels — whether it’s your first time working with clay or you’re an experienced maker looking for a fun creative session.
These workshops are a great way to sip cider, play with clay, and create something handmade to enjoy.

Clay & Cider is our fun, social pottery event on location at [North Country Hard Cider](https://www.northcountryhardcider.com/) - perfect for a 
relaxed creative afternoon with friends. Come and create a Cozy Mug on Saturday, December 6th. A great way to sip cider, play with clay, 
and create something handmade. [Register online](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/clay-cider) to join in.

## Studio Events

Mark your calendars for Artist Sunday, November 30 from 10am–2pm. It’s our pottery sale timed with the nationwide movement to shop handmade and local.

## Festivals ~ Fairs ~ Markets

We love when clay meets community!  This season, we’re proud to participate in the [North Country Cider Winter Market](https://www.northcountryhardcider.com/events) on Saturday, 12/13 from 12–5 p.m., where we’ll be part of the creative buzz alongside makers, cider, and good company. Come join us there to see what we’ve been making, and maybe shape something on the spot!

Our mission goes beyond the wheel. We’ll be supporting the Dover Food Pantry through the “Main Street Food Drive”—please bring a non-perishable item when you visit the studio or attend one of our classes to help give back. Your participation makes a difference!

Additionally, save the date for **Festival of Trees**  Friday, 12/5 from 4-8 p.m. at the Rivermill at Dover Landing (2 Washington Street). We’ll have a special display and involvement in the festivities—come say hello and see our community spirit in action.


We can’t wait to welcome you back into the studio, to the wheel, and out in the community. Thank you for being part of the creative, caring, and vibrant family that is Dover Pottery Studio. Whether you’re rolling some clay or rolling into a market, we’re thrilled you’re here.


Warmly,

Kim & the Dover Pottery Studio Team
