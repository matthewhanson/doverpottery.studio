We’re excited to offer a fresh lineup of creative classes this fall!

- [Explore Wheel](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/explore-wheel): Single session to give the wheel a try - we fire and glaze your piece for you to pick up later.
- 2-Week Class – [Throw & Trim](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/throw-trim): Short and sweet. Throw a piece on the wheel, then return in a week to trim and decorate
- 3-Week Class - [Make-a-Mug](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/wheel-projects): Perfect for beginners and anyone who wants to craft a cozy companion for their favorite fall drinks
- [Clay Whistle Workshop](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/handbuilding-projects): Explore ancient musical traditions and create your own handmade instrument
