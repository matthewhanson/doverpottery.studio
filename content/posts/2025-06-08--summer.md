Hey Potters!

Summer’s here, and things are heating up—in the kiln and in the studio. We’ve got fresh classes, cool new art on the walls, and plenty of chances to get your hands muddy. Whether you’re sipping cider while hand-building, spinning up new skills on the wheel, or just stopping by to see what’s new, there’s something for everyone this season. Let’s dive in!

## Session 4 Sign‑ups Are Open
Registration is now live for Session 4! Here’s what’s happening this season:

- [Explore Wheel one–session classes](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/explore-wheel), perfect for trying your hand at the wheel and get a finished pottery piece to pick up later.

- [Clay & Cider](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/clay-cider) returns to [North Country Hard Cider](https://www.northcountryhardcider.com/), pairing local cider with hand-building fun—always a crowd favorite. Our June birdfeeder classes are full, but stay tuned for July and August classes.

- 7-week classes: Tuesday morning [Foundations of Pottery](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/foundations-of-pottery), and [Mixed-level Wheel](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/mixed-level-wheel) classes on Wednesday and Thursday evening. Students in our 7-week classes also get to come in during Open Studio times for more practice.

- 4-week Intro classes: On Monday mornings we have [Intro to Handbuilding](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/intro-to-handbuilding), with [Intro to Wheel](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/intro-to-throwing) on Wednesday afternoons.  

- We are having our first [Skill Session](https://doverpotterystudio.kilnfire.com/classes/skill-sessions) for intermediate and advanced students. These focused drop‑in classes dive deep into specific techniques, the first one focusing on making large bowls.

## Spring Fling Pottery Sale a Big Hit
In May, we hosted our Spring Fling Pottery Sale where members and students sold their ceramics—it was a joyful success! We’re excited to announce that we'll be scheduling another sale this November, just in time for holiday‑season shopping.

## Art Beat Exhibition
Our walls are now home to two talented local artists as part of [Dover Art Beat](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ97a5RJj6d/), a program supported by the Dover Arts Commission. It’s been a pleasure to spotlight their work and bring even more creative inspiration into the studio.

## Gallery Additions from Maine Pottery Tour
We’ve also expanded our studio gallery with new pieces from this year’s [Maine Pottery Tour](https://www.instagram.com/mainepotterytour/). These works—by local Maine artists—are not only beautiful but serve as teaching tools. Kim uses them in class to illustrate form, texture, and glaze techniques. We’re grateful to these artists for sharing their work and enriching our learning environment.

Thank you for being part of our creative community. Whether you’re just starting out or ready to deepen your practice, there’s something for everyone this summer. We hope to see you in class!
